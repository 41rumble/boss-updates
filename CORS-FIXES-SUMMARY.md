# CORS Issue Fixes Summary

## Problem

The frontend application was unable to connect to the backend API due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues. The browser was blocking requests from the frontend to the backend with errors like:

```
Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://www.dougsnews.com/backend/api/auth/login. (Reason: CORS request did not succeed). Status code: (null).
```

## Root Cause

1. The Apache proxy configuration was already set up to map `/backend/` to `http://127.0.0.1:5150/api/`, but our frontend code was still including the `/api` prefix in API requests.

2. CORS headers were not properly configured on the server.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend API Configuration

- Updated all API endpoints in `src/services/api.ts` to remove the `/api` prefix since it's already included in the Apache proxy configuration.
- For example, changed `/api/auth/login` to `/auth/login`.

### 2. CORS Configuration

- Added Apache configuration files for CORS:
  - `.htaccess` file for the backend
  - `cors-config.conf` for Apache VirtualHost configuration

- Updated the backend Express server to properly handle CORS:
  - Simplified CORS configuration to allow all origins
  - Added better error handling for CORS issues

### 3. Documentation

- Added `CORS-SETUP.md` with detailed instructions on how to configure Apache for CORS
- Added this summary document

## How to Test

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Try to log in with the following credentials:
   - Email: any email address
   - Password: "password"

## Additional Troubleshooting

If you still encounter CORS issues:

1. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify that the Apache configuration is correctly set up
3. Make sure the backend server is running and accessible
4. Check that the proxy configuration is correct:
   ```
   ProxyPass /backend/ http://127.0.0.1:5150/api/
   ProxyPassReverse /backend/ http://127.0.0.1:5150/api/
   ```
5. Ensure that the CORS headers are being properly set by the server
